## Knowledge Graph Creation

### Current Implementation:
```python
# Commented out in the original code
# for data in chunks:
#     documents = [Document(page_content=data)]
#     graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(documents)
#     print(f"Nodes:{graph_documents[0].nodes}\n")
#     print(f"Relationships:{graph_documents[0].relationships}")
#     #graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents)
```

### Improvements:

1. **Batch Processing**: Instead of processing one chunk at a time, consider batching the chunks for more efficient processing:

```python
batch_size = 10  # Adjust based on your needs and memory constraints
for i in range(0, len(chunks), batch_size):
    batch = chunks[i:i+batch_size]
    documents = [Document(page_content=chunk) for chunk in batch]
    graph_documents = llm_transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(documents)
    graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents)
```

2. **Custom Schema**: Define a custom schema for your knowledge graph to ensure consistency and meaningful relationships:

```python
custom_schema = {
    "node_types": ["Concept", "Entity", "Event"],
    "relationship_types": ["RELATED_TO", "CAUSES", "PART_OF"]
}
llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm, schema=custom_schema)
```

3. **Entity Linking**: Implement entity linking to connect mentions of the same entity across different chunks:

```python
from langchain_community.utils import get_entites  # Hypothetical import

def link_entities(graph_documents):
    entities = get_entities(graph_documents)
    for entity in entities:
        # Create a unique node for each entity
        graph.merge_node("Entity", "name", entity)
    
    for doc in graph_documents:
        for node in doc.nodes:
            if node["label"] == "Entity":
                # Link document nodes to the unique entity nodes
                graph.create_relationship(
                    "MENTIONS",
                    "Document",
                    "id",
                    doc.id,
                    "Entity",
                    "name",
                    node["properties"]["name"]
                )

# Use this function after converting documents to graph documents
link_entities(graph_documents)
```

## Knowledge Graph Querying

### Current Implementation:
```python
db = Neo4jVector.from_documents(docs, embeddings, url="bolt://localhost:7687", username=username, password=password)
query = "What should I do if I have cataract?"
results = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
print("THIS IS THE ANSWER:\n", results[0].page_content)
```

### Improvements:

1. **Combine Vector and Graph Queries**: Leverage both vector similarity and graph structure for more comprehensive results:

```python
from langchain_community.graphs.neo4j_graph import Neo4jGraph

def hybrid_search(query, k=2):
    # Vector similarity search
    vector_results = db.similarity_search(query, k=k)
    
    # Graph-based search
    cypher_query = """
    MATCH (d:Document)-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity)
    WHERE e.name IN $entities
    RETURN d.content AS content, count(DISTINCT e) AS relevance
    ORDER BY relevance DESC
    LIMIT $limit
    """
    entities = get_entities(query)  # Use an NER model to extract entities from the query
    graph_results = graph.query(cypher_query, {"entities": entities, "limit": k})
    
    # Combine and rank results (simple method, can be improved)
    combined_results = vector_results + graph_results
    return sorted(combined_results, key=lambda x: x.relevance, reverse=True)[:k]

results = hybrid_search(query)
for result in results:
    print(f"Relevance: {result.relevance}\nContent: {result.content}\n")
```

2. **Query Expansion**: Use the graph structure to expand the initial query for better coverage:

```python
def expand_query(query):
    expansion_prompt = f"Expand the query '{query}' with related terms and concepts."
    expanded_terms = llm(expansion_prompt).split(", ")
    
    cypher_query = """
    MATCH (e:Entity)
    WHERE e.name IN $terms
    MATCH (e)-[:RELATED_TO]->(r:Entity)
    RETURN DISTINCT r.name AS related_term
    LIMIT 5
    """
    graph_expansions = graph.query(cypher_query, {"terms": expanded_terms})
    
    return query + " " + " ".join(expanded_terms + [r.related_term for r in graph_expansions])

expanded_query = expand_query(query)
results = hybrid_search(expanded_query)
```

3. **Context-Aware Answers**: Use the graph structure to provide more context in the answers:

```python
def get_context(result):
    cypher_query = """
    MATCH (d:Document {content: $content})-[:MENTIONS]->(e:Entity)
    MATCH (e)-[r]->(related:Entity)
    RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS relationship_type, related.name AS related_entity
    LIMIT 5
    """
    context = graph.query(cypher_query, {"content": result.content})
    return context

for result in results:
    context = get_context(result)
    print(f"Answer: {result.content}")
    print("Related concepts:")
    for c in context:
        print(f"- {c.related_entity} ({c.relationship_type})")
    print()
```

## Additional Considerations

1. **Incremental Updates**: Implement a system to incrementally update the knowledge graph as new information becomes available, rather than rebuilding it from scratch each time.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Profile your graph queries and optimize them using Neo4j's EXPLAIN and PROFILE commands. Consider using indexes on frequently queried properties.
